Life is too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you.
If someone wants you in their life, they will make room for you. 
You shouldn't have to fight for a spot. 
And never, ever insist yourself to someone who continuously overlooks your worth. 
To seek out new life and new life and new civilizations?
